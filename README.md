A GUI app for the 1Password command-line tool on Sailfish OS.

Version 0.4 - <b>Still in early development</b> - please see Limitations & Issues below.

Licensed under GNU GPLv3.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

- A 1Password.com account (paid, free trial available).
- An active network connection. As of now, at least, the CLI needs to be online to access data. While it can cache items, it still needs to check if it's the latest version of the item.
- Installation of the 1Password command-line tool in /usr/local/bin or another directory in your $PATH. (The app has not been tested with the tool in a location other than /usr/local/bin). Permission for "op" to run as an executable. More info and download link:<br>

- Addition of the shorthand "quaycentsfos" to your device's CLI. The shorthand is device-specific. Adding this allows the app to avoid storing any secrets and provides the user with flexibility when using the CLI separately with their own shorthand or default domain etc. More info on adding the shorthand is available at:<br>

<h3>Limitations & Issues</h3>

- Lockout timer is optional as there were previously issues with it when set to longer times (15 and 30 minutes). Since then I've not been able to find any problems with current set of times (5, 2 mins, 30 seconds). The app is still in early development so best practice would be to lock the app after using it. App will move user back to sign-in page should they attempt to access data from CLI after CLI's 30 min session has expired but this doesn't protect data that is on the screen, and is of course not intended as any kind of a substitute for user locking their vault(s) or using the timer.
- Lockout timer only goes by the app's interaction with the CLI and isn't reset by any user interaction that doesn't access data, such as swiping back, going to Settings, etc. Be aware that leaving the app on a page with a TOTP will mean that the CLI's timer won't expire, since the one-time password is obtained using the CLI.
- As of now, Login item page only lists username/password/TOTP/website. All data (besides a TOTP if there is one) in other categories will display but may still have some formatting issues in some entries.
- Items are read-only, may get around to adding editing functionality down the road.
- No support for multiple accounts or for groups. (No plans for this, app is designed for individual use.)
- Items are not listed alphabetically so search method is, for now, necessary as opposed to scrolling through a list.
- Clipboard icon on item details page may be somewhat misaligned if text size is enlarged on a device's Display Settings. Will edit code to work around this somehow, prefer the medium clipboard icon to the small one, there is no small-plus icon size for the clipboard icon as of now.
- Lock icon on cover may appear somewhat smaller than other standard cover icons. No lock icon available under the Cover category so went with the small icon for now.

<h3>Rationale</h3>

- Having a 1Password client that keeps Ambience on user's device, providing for a better and more consistent SFOS experience.
- Official 1Password app that supports 1Password.com accounts requires Android version 5 or greater and is therefore incompatible with Alien Dalvik on Xperia X.
- Overall plus to have more native SFOS apps and fewer dependencies on Android versions, experimenting with how different apps may utilize the interface that SFOS provides.
- Closer to having an official SFOS client someday?

<h3>Privacy & Security</h3>

- Users can lock the vault(s) by tapping the padlock button on the app's cover icon, swiping back in the app to the Sign-in page, or choosing 'Lock' on the pull-down menu on any other page, if this option is enabled (on by default).
- By assigning the shorthand 'quaycentsfos', app is able to avoid requiring any secrets to be stored. User also has control over what accounts the shorthand is or is not associated with, incase they'd like to use the CLI for separate accounts and not use a GUI for all, or to continue using the CLI after revoking QuayCentral signin access, etc. While the default domain value 'my' is now the only option available to new users (AFAIK), it was the case previously that personalized domains could be chosen, hence the classification of this data as secret.
- Master password entered by user is cleared immediately following its passing to the CLI and is never stored. Item usernames and passwords are only ever in RAM, are cleared when the vault is locked, and are only copied to the clipboard if user so chooses.
- When removing the login access for QuayCentral, user will need to get back into Terminal but may also need to remove the CLI from authorized devices on their 1Password profile page. Info on how to sign out directly in Terminal, as well as using the 'forget' flag and command, are here:<br>
